This is the fourth lab for the course 732A94 Advanced Programming in R at Link√∂pings Universitet. 

In this lab we were tasked with creating a package that implements a linear regression model which we achieved through QR decomposition.

This lab was worked on by Victor Guill and Christian Kammerer.
